## Comments for Portfolio 1 project

I have chosen to make my portfolio website very simple and clean. I want the whole focus to be on the work I have done, so I wanted the cards to stand out and be very visually simple and easy for everyone to understand. At this moment I have made the decision to wait with certain features. I will add social media icons and such later on when I plan to start up new social media accounts for Bekkholt. I am also planning on adding a more specific "about me" page and a "contact" page when I have more projects to show, and more ways to contact me. I want this portfolio site to grow with me, and be updated as I work more and learn more.
